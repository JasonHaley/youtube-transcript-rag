{"speaker": "", "title": "A look at the Azure Developer CLI", "videoId": "OWzgJwJff4E", "description": "This is a recording of the July 28, 2022 meeting.\n\nThe Azure Developer CLI (azd) announced their public preview this month (more information on the announcement is here). This is a new and exciting tool (with related extensions for VS Code and Visual Studio) that helps you get started with Azure even fast. By the way, this is not a replacement for the Azure CLI.\n\nIn this session we'll take a look at what the azd CLI can do for you, the VS Code extension and Visual Studio tooling, look over the templates that are currently available and then look into the detail of how it all works and how you can make your own templates.\n\nWhy should you care? Using the azd tool, I've created my own template and am able to deploy an ASP.NET web site (to an Azure web app) that communicates to an ASP.NET API (running in Azure Container Apps) all with one command.\n\nIf you are looking to play with new technologies and start off with reference implementations - this is going to be a tool you want to check out!\n\nAbout the speaker\nJason is an independent consultant who focuses on .NET, Azure, Kubernetes and Angular.
