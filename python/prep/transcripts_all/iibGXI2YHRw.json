Maybe you build a cronjob or a Windows service to execute some code on a schedule? Maybe you have a background task in your web application?\n\nNo matter what you're doing, you are probably building infrastructure to support these background tasks. That can be costly, unreliable, and difficult to debug.\n\nIn this presentation, you will be offered an alternative approach to building background services by taking advantage of Azure Logic Apps and Azure Functions. You see real-world scenarios that were implemented and that are running right now!\n\nSPEAKER BIO\nKevin Griffin is an author, teacher, mentor, and consultant focusing in software development.
