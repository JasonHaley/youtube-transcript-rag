In this demo-heavy talk, we will first use the OWASP application as a foil to illustrate basic web application vulnerabilities. Then we will show how a WAF can be inserted in front of the web application firewall and how that can help improve awareness. This is not a deep talk on WAF rules, but more focused on why you might want a WAF and some basics including triggering the WAF and looking at signals.\n\nBill Wilder is CTO at Finomial which is a born-in-the-cloud SaaS company running on Azure, an Azure MVP, a book and course author, adjunct professor of cybersecurity (focused on Azure), and founder (11 years ago!) of Boston Azure.
