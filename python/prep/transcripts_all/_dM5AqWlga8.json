In the past, I have used plain old MSBuild, TeamCity, Cake, and Octopus Deploy and now I focus primarily on Azure DevOps (formerly known as Visual Studio Team Services VSTS).\n\nDevOps and Azure are my focus of late and they are my main passion apart from learning new technologies.  I went from no knowledge of Azure to an Azure MVP in under 2 years and along the journey passed 9 exams, I learn new skills quickly and I keep on top of a number of technologies and a life learner."}
