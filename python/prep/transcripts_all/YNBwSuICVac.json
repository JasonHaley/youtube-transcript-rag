This was good, but also we knew it wasn't scalable or sustainable. Also, there were difficulties maintaining a public facing FAQ on our website as well as an internal set of answers to common questions.\nTo help alleviate some of that burden, we stood up a chatbot using QnA Maker and MS Bot Builder, with QnA Maker serving as our canonical Knowledge Base. We then also set up a Static Site Generator to pull from the Knowledge Base APIs and publish a public facing FAQ page to syndicate the same content.\nThe project is all open source ( https://github.com/VermontDepartmentOfHealth/covid-bot ), but let's explore it together. This talk will briefly cover the technologies in play, how they're being applied, and some of the gotchas we've faced along the way. If there's time and interest, we can do a 15-minute demo of standing up your very own bot from scratch.\nQnA Maker and cognitive services got some nice refreshes at Build 2020 a couple months ago, so there's never been a better time to start thinking about how you can build up a single source of truth for common questions, and then syndicate it almost anywhere (chatbots, text, phone, ms teams, static content).\n\nSlides are here: https://docgov.dev/slides/chat-bot/\n\nSPEAKER BIO\nKyle Mitofsky\n\nKyle Mitofsky is the Principal Software Developer at Vermont Department of Health.
