These companies leverage the seemingly endless scalability and the elastic pricing model of the cloud. Nevertheless, many projects still cannot use cloud services for various reasons. These may encompass regulatory restrictions, data protection, or just having an existing on-premises infrastructure.\nWhile these are all valid causes, why not combine an existing on-premises infrastructure with the power of the cloud? This is where Azure Arc comes into play. Azure Arc allows to project on-premises infrastructure into Azure and then apply Azure services like Azure Monitor or Azure Policy on the on-premises infrastructure.\n\nThis session shows how a Swiss company uses Azure Arc to manage an on-premises Kubernetes cluster. Using Azure Arc enables the development team to leverage the power of the cloud and provide a streamlined DevOps process. All this can be achieved without the cluster being accessible from the internet.\n\nAbout the speaker:\nWolfgang Ofner is a Microsoft Certified Trainer and works as a Senior Software Architect for Azure, DevOps, and .NET solutions at bbv Software Service in Zurich.
