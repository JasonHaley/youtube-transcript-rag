{"speaker": "", "title": "Pamela Fox: Building a RAG app to chat with your data", "videoId": "3Zh9MEuyTQo", "description": "This is a recording of the March 28, 2024 meeting.\n\nOne of the most popular use cases for generative AI is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented-Generation), a technique that feeds context to an LLM (large language model) so that it can answer questions according to sources. Thousands of developers have deployed RAG applications to chat with their data, both for internal enterprise data (like HR or support) and external public data (like government or retail). In this talk, I'll show how to build a RAG with Azure technology, like Azure AI search and Azure OpenAI, and share best practices for data ingestion, orchestration, and evaluation.\n\nPamela Fox\n\nPamela Fox is a Cloud Advocate in Python at Microsoft.
