In the present day, we have the technology to make it a reality. The Computer Vision service can be deployed in a matter of minutes for a simple proof of concept, but features robust capabilities for AI use cases at even the enterprise level. This session will discuss a brief history of Computer Vision, the Cognitive Vision service, demo some of the capabilities, and help you build an example of costs for deployments.\n\nAbout the Speaker:\nChris Seferlis is a Client Technology Lead at Microsoft where, for the past 3 years he\u2019s helped customers bring their technical strategies to reality with a heavy focus on how they are using their data.
