Must Learn Kusto Query Language.\nKusto is a service for storing and running interactive analytics over Big Data. Kusto was designed from scratch to be a \u201cbig data\u201d repository for Azure and easy to query using Kusto Query Language (KQL). As we make progress in our migration to the cloud, we are learning new ways to monitor and alert on resources and services. Microsoft has consolidated many services under the umbrella of \u2018Azure Monitor.\u2019 Whether you are \u2018detecting and diagnose issues across applications and dependencies,\u2019 \u2018correlate infrastructure issues with Azure Monitor for VMs,\u2019 \u2018drill into your SQL database monitoring data with Log Analytics\u2019 you will be using \u2018Azure Monitor.\u2019 Azure Monitor uses a version of the KQL used by Azure Data Explorer that is suitable for simple log queries but also includes advanced functionality such as aggregations, joins, and smart analytics. Going forward, the KQL must be your primary resource for querying the Azure Monitor log. In this 95% demo session, I will show you some \u2018getting started\u2019 tips and a few sophisticated queries using KQL. I will do a live demo, generating an alert using KQL. At the end of this session, beginners will have a solid knowledge about KQL that they can build upon by themselves; others will also learn many advance operators, including machine learning ones. Come and learn about the future of monitoring and investigations of Azure services.\n\nTaiob Ali, Microsoft Data Platform MVP, is an accomplished technical leader with a proven record of success.
