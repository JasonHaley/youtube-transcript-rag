But when it comes to repetitive tasks, you can save time and reduce errors by executing a tested, repeatable process. This session dives into the scriptibility of Azure through the Azure Command Line Interface and the Azure Powershell cmdlets.\nWe\u2019ll quickly go over installation and general use, including how to accept input from users and other sources like KeyVault. In the case of the Azure CLI, we\u2019ll see how to parse output with JMESPath queries for formatting and for using the results in subsequent commands. Then we\u2019ll see how to execute these commands and scripts from a terminal, the Azure Cloud Shell, Automation Runbooks and even the Azure Android app! Finally, we will introduce Bicep, the new domain specific language for coding ARM templates.\nWhether you simply want to have a virtual machine automatically started every morning and stopped every night, or you need to provision complex multi-tenant resource deployments, automation scripting is the solution. This session will give you the knowledge to get started automating Azure right away. If you have an Azure subscription, bring your laptop or mobile device and hack along with me.\n\nBob Crowley is a Senior Software Developer in Portland Maine where he builds solutions in the .Net and Azure ecosystems. He has been writing bugs for over fifteen years, mostly in the financial industry despite (or because?) still not knowing the difference between a debit and a credit.\nIn his free time he likes to make the most of both weeks of Maine's summer out on the water either in a kayak or saltwater fishing."}
