    "# Lab 2: Build a RAG Application with Semantic Kernel, Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Like with [Lab 1](./1_search.ipynb) you will use the transcripts from the [Boston Azure Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/bostonazure)(included in this repo) to create a RAG application with Semantic Kernel. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "* Load the environment variables needed from the .env file (this assumes you are running this in VS Code)\n",
    "* Learn how to interact with AzureOpenAI using Semantic Kernel (not the AzureOpenAI client like we did in Lab 1)\n",
    "* Learn the features of Semantic Kernel needed to implement a RAG application\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "1. Create functionality to provide a text query to an LLM using a prompt template\n",
    "2. Have an in-memory vector store searched for the most similar video transcripts given a text query\n",
    "3. Send a prompt to OpenAI to then get a response to the query\n",
    "\n",
    "> NOTE:\n",
    "> \n",
    "> There is no web UI to this \"application\" we are going to build - only this notebook.\n",
